#Socius

Socius - meaning "companion" in Latin - is an innovative mobile social media app designed to connect people through shared experiences
and events. With Socius, you can easily search for events, see which ones your friends are attending (or wish to attend), and even buy 
tickets together. Itâ€™s the perfect way to link up with old friends, meet new friends, coordinate plans, and share your experiences at concerts, sports games, and more. 
Socius turns every event into a social experience, bringing people closer through the moments they enjoy most.

Socius was developed by Jonathan He and Eric Zhao (both JHU students) for the HopHacks competition. We plan to continue working on this 
project as much as possible in the coming weeks and submit it to an incubator program (such as YC) with the ultimate goal of publishing 
the app on the App Store and the Google Play Store spread across the world.
